    <h2>About This App</h2>

    <p>
      This app is designed to help users manage kitchen expenses and track daily entries easily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users can add items, calculate totals, and export data as PDF.
      The app works offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to provide a simple and easy-to-use expense tracking tool.
